    "## Bayesian Billiards\n",
    "A famous thought experiment comparing the Bayesian and frequentist approach is 'Bayesian billiards'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a rectangular billiard table with length $L$. We throw one black ball on the table, which will move around until it stops, at a random $x$-coordinate of the table, and call this $z$, $0\\leq z\\leq L$. For the purposes of this thought experiment, suppose we don't know $z$, and want to estimate it. We could do this by throwing $n$ white balls onto the table, and seeing whether they end up to the left, or to the right of the black ball. By counting how many are to each side, we can reasonably 'guess' the value of $z$. To make the calculation easier, suppose $L=1$. \n",

    "When doing measurements of a certain physical relation, you would not expect that all points are within one standard deiviation of the theoretical relation. If you assume a big enough sample, we can assume a normal distribution (CLT) thus then the chance of getting a datapoint outside of the 1-$\\sigma$ region is about $32$%, so you would expect about a third of the measurements to be (at least) 1-$\\sigma$ away from the exact relation. However, as we go further and further away from the relation, we expect less and less datapoints there. One of these outliers, a datapoint very far away from the relation, can substantially impact the fit, because it can substatnially change the mean, for example. Hence, there is need to reduce the sensitivty of these outliers. We will do this by removing the outliers, since there is always a change on outliers. Outliers can have multiple causes, for example unmodeled experimental uncertainty or (rare) noice sources, for which aren't always able to account for. One process of removing outliers is by hand. However, as one could image, this is far from ideal, as it can be very subjective and hard to reproduce. \n",
